Unified Threat Detection Lab
Overview:

Welcome to the Unified Threat Detection Lab! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to setting up an integrated security monitoring solution. By leveraging powerful tools such as Wireshark, Snort, Wazuh, Suricata, and Splunk, this lab provides hands-on experience in creating a robust defense against potential threats and enhancing incident response capabilities.
Prerequisites:

Before embarking on the lab setup, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

    Virtual Machine Environment:
        Install a reliable virtualization tool such as VMware or VirtualBox on your host machine.
        Create virtual machines (VMs) for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, allocating sufficient resources for optimal performance.

    Operating System:
        All virtual machines should run Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for consistency throughout the lab environment.

    Linux Command Line:
        A foundational understanding of basic Linux command line operations is recommended for efficient execution of commands and configurations.

Steps:
1. Setting Up the Virtual Environment:

    Install Virtualization Tool:
        Install VMware or VirtualBox according to your system specifications.
        Follow the platform-specific instructions to complete the installation.

    Create Virtual Machines:
        Configure VMs for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with appropriate resource allocations (CPU, RAM, storage).
        Ensure network connectivity between the VMs for seamless communication.

2. Installing and Configuring Wireshark:

    Install Wireshark:
        Use the package manager to install Wireshark on the designated VM.
        Verify the installation and explore Wireshark's graphical interface.

    Network Traffic Analysis:
        Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
        Utilize Wireshark's features to filter and dissect packets.

    Save Captured Packets:
        Save captured packets in a designated folder for future reference and analysis.

3. Deploying Snort and Suricata:

    Install Snort and Suricata:
        Install Snort and Suricata on separate VMs either through the package manager or by compiling from source.

    Configure IDS Rules:
        Explore the provided configuration files to customize rules for detecting common network attacks.
        Ensure proper configuration and initialization of Snort and Suricata.

    Test IDS Systems:
        Use predefined attack patterns to test the effectiveness of the IDS systems.
        Verify that Snort and Suricata can successfully detect and respond to simulated attacks.

4. Implementing Wazuh for Log Analysis:

    Install Wazuh Manager:
        Install the Wazuh manager on a dedicated VM using the provided installation instructions.

    Deploy Wazuh Agents:
        Deploy Wazuh agents on VMs running Wireshark, Snort, and Suricata.
        Configure Wazuh rules for log analysis and threat detection.

5. Integrating Splunk for Centralized Log Management:

    Set Up Splunk:
        Install Splunk on a dedicated VM, configuring necessary settings and inputs.

    Configure Log Forwarding:
        Configure Wazuh and IDS systems to send logs to Splunk for centralized log management.

    Create Custom Dashboards:
        Develop custom dashboards in Splunk to visualize security events and facilitate efficient monitoring.

6. Testing the Integrated Solution:

    Simulate Network Attacks:
        Use available tools or scripts to simulate network attacks.
        Monitor the response of the integrated solution to simulated threats.

    Analyze Logs in Splunk:
        Dive into Splunk to analyze logs for detected security events.
        Ensure the system effectively captures and reports incidents.

    Verify Component Functionality:
        Cross-reference results and logs to verify the functionality of each integrated component.

7. Optimizing and Fine-Tuning:

    Fine-Tune IDS Rules:
        Based on observed results, fine-tune Snort and Suricata rules to enhance detection capabilities.

    Customize Wazuh Rules:
        Customize Wazuh rules to address specific use cases or enhance sensitivity to particular threats.

    Explore Advanced Features:
        Delve into advanced features of Wireshark, Snort, Wazuh, Suricata, and Splunk to deepen understanding.

Conclusion:
